The breakdown in the drop is adeptly used as a vocal chop, which contributes to the vibrant drop in the record. Personally, we consider Zitron’s performance our favourite of the 5 collaborations.\n"," The question nonetheless arises: shall there be any evolution to this endeared yet repetitive sound in the coming time?

Needless to say, repetition leads to annoyance and when the success of a project is borrowed too many times, its novelty eventually wears off. Could the same be said about the newest project from Alan Walker, Dash Berlin, and Vikkstar? Probably not.\n"," “Better Off (Alone, Pt. III)” is surprisingly praiseworthy, rather than an unneeded release wanting to gather streams.\n"," An unexpected team-up, Alan Walker is synonymous mostly with the commercial dance-pop arena; known for his midtempo, radio-ready productions, the Nordic alias has retained a massive influence over the years (although getting mixed reactions due to his involvement with music creation). His latest album, “Walkerverse, Pt. I & II,” is a compilation of tracks tailored to trend: ranging from pop-punk to the signature electro midtempo pop. Meanwhile, Dash Berlin has been quietly churning out festival-intended tracks and edits with their melodic progressive house/trance sound, the most recent being “Time After Time” with DubVision and Emma Hewitt.\n"," At the same time, this forms the debut for British YouTuber Vikkstar in music. It’s hard to discern his commitment to the technical aspects, making it hard to shrug off the belief of whether his feature is a brand deal of sorts.\n"," That aside, “Better Off (Alone, Pt. III)” sticks to a wisely chosen policy: not to deter too much from the already successful formula. Right from the start, the song sets a good impression with the nostalgic riff opening the show, as enticing female vocals take the lead. Hyping up the tease, catchy piano chords get the ball rolling with striding claps, swiftly getting to the crux of the track. The main hook instantly grabs attention as the original’s melody pairs up with a piano-led deep house chorus, and together with the superb vocals— it just works! Sure, ingenuity isn’t the prime concern here, but rather making the most of the opportunity. A polished dance-pop production and capable songwriting (owing to its creators) form a record that puts a refreshing spin on the 2000s hit, not relying entirely on the sampling to do the trick.\n"," Recommendable and repeatable, “Better Off (Alone, Pt. III)” is a late-summer contender for a viral song, alongside being a more-than-decent homage to the often unceremoniously sampled trance classic.'. Output only 5 words separated by ','.

I kept watching him growing, reaching new and important milestones. I saw him earning his first support on Hardwell on Air in 2017, his first million plays on SC, then an official main release a few months ago… And now, with his loyal partner Patrick Key, there is another important release on Maxximize, “Meant For You“. Blasterjaxx’s label doesn’t have many releases, but it’s finding promising names, such as Declain, ANG and Mountblaq.\n"," The duo Wildvibes-Patrick Key is accompanied by Lasso the Sun, providing an excellent performance with some high-pitched segments that add a refreshing twist to a classic element of the genre. A sweet guitar and a piano support Lasso the Sun in the breakdown, in a calm and delicate section. The vibe is almost “poppish”, until the Progressive House lead slowly introducing itselfs in the buildup, escalating into a powerful drop. Manse (who worked with Wildvibes in “Our Simphony”) made this “sweet” kind of Progressive famous, but Wildvibes and Patrick Key have added a further layer of passion into it. It gives me peaceful vibes. In addition to that familiar feeling, we have a splendid melodic pattern.\n"," A final detail that I want to describe is the second breakdown, where the poppish vibe is replaced by an elegant sequence of strings. The precision and the care put into these “calmer” sections, which are often too predictable in Progressive House, are amazing. I almost had more fun exploring them than with the drops!\n"," Wildvibes and Patrick Key made a true gem. “Meant For You” has everything: a quality vocal, a fantastic melody, a “passionate” atmosphere that (in my opinion) is incredibly underrated and a special care in adding a magical aura to the breakdowns.

His efforts are admirably ingenious, building a particular sound design while experimenting with the BLK RSE project in the spare time. His interactive-ness with the fans is an added bonus, as we can see in the “KAAZEMAS” idea where he gives away bonus contents in the year-end.\n"," On a personal note, I haven’t found myself as excited to BLK RSE’s latest creations, as both “Chrome” and “Systemize” didn’t stuck with me for long; with “Young Ones”, however, the Swedish act has changed my recent colder stance towards him. It’s the jolly Christmas after all, magic happens!\n"," It’s a slower take on KAAZE’s usual progressive demeanour, tagging along the familiar influences in the lead and a gentle, heartfelt vocal by Elle Vee seizing the most of the breakdown.

Released a couple of weeks back by STMPD RCRDS, today’s victim is the result obtained by the renowned House music aliases Siks and Julian Jordan: “Juice”.\n"," Speaking more precisely, the potential in the premise here was pretty convincing. Siks is a talented up-and-coming mastermind in the Future House and Bass House scene, often capable to derive some twists to the formulas overused by many others, and is captured through a funky or more experimental sense. Similarly, Julian Joran has developed his glitchy Bass Hosue style and has evolved a lot, with hits such as “Diamonds” and “Funk” with his long-time colleague Garrix, yet shining through with solo efforts such as “Thunder” and “Hyper”, my favorite among the bunch.\n"," In hopes for a juicier outcome (no pun intended) from their time shared on their collaboration efforts on this, I particularly felt that the squeaky lead and the melody deployed were rather predictable if one has heard any previous releases from Jordan.

I wasn’t fully satisfied, even though I dig the energy consistent in the bassline (it’s Bass House after all!) and how the duo enacted a hooking pattern.
