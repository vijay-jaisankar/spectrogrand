• Excellent mood in the buildup section
• Predictable features in the drop
• Robust track with clean sound design
Jay Eskar’s debut has been awaited by me for quite some time now, owing to his unwavering talented efforts on the scene. It had to be either Hexagon or the No Copyright Sounds label, as he found breakthrough with Mixmash records (recommendation: “Ignite”). The Mexican creator has been devoted to Future Bounce for years now, reinventing the style to his ingenuity, once brought to fame by Brooks and Mike Williams.
Forging a sonical alliance with Doxed, a young creator who is into Bass and Future House spectrum, and Rico 56 for the vocal department, the group debuted last Friday with “Let’s Run Away” and needless to say, the overall idea is fascinating!
This might not be the best of the said team’s outcome, to be brutally honest, as the drop holds onto a few run-of-the-mill ingredients. Instead, I tried paying attention to the creative build-up, where Doxed cleverly placed growls (analogous to ones in his “INDUSTRY BABY” flip) that dominate the framework with its aggressive demeanour.
Playing the role of an experienced vocalist, Rico 56 made the instrumental more lively, while the drop suffered some setbacks with its standard Jay Eskar trademarks: bouncy and biting low-end, electro-infused lead with a notable handiwork on the sound design aspect. After the previous performances organized meticulously by Eskar, I perhaps expected to be greeted by that same “wow” factor here, only to miss it.
Nonetheless, I am grateful to have an entertaining experience and, for once, forget the nitpicks. These are talented names that deserve to be on even bigger imprints, hence my best wishes to them!
