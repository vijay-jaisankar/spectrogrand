The eminent dance music label Enhanced continues to prove its quality in the scene without any falter, as they further introduce new talents. Unveiling an enticing production from the debutants Maxim Schunk and Raven & Kreyn, this release has been voiced by the talented singer Bishøp. Titled “My Name”, the track showcases charm and groove simultaneously.
Drawing inspiration from 90s classic R&B hit song “Say My Name”, this release moulds and flips the vintage track into a modern contemporary future house production, and the result is delightful! The breakdown features the enchanting vocal from Bishøp, further candy-coated with vibrant dance pianos in the backdrop.
Swirling around, the breakdown brims with sumptuous house vibes. A brief riser introduces the rhythmic drop into the scene. Consisting of usual future house synths coupled with an alluring and energetic melody, the drop takes over with peppiness and zeal. The melody itself has a unique tone to it, which makes the drop lively.
In few words, “My Name” revamps the original, and does it perfectly. Props to the artists who proficiently crafted this idea!
