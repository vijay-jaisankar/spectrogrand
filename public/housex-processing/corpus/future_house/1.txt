• Excellent vocal performance by Eddie Jonsson
• The guitar in the breakdown is noteworthy
• Predictable future bounce drop
Dropgun is one of my favorite duos, and it’s not just their music. They have an excellent marketing strategy, focused on their purple mascot, Little Drop. You can find it on Dropgun’s recent covers and videos, and many of their releases tell his story. It’s like a Dropgun Cinematic Universe, orbiting around Little Drop.
Speaking about their future bounce/electro house approach, which is similar to Brooks one, in the latest releases, I find it rather catchy. It doesn’t particularly stand out from the mass compared to the other structures used by Dropgun, but it keeps the right energy while leaving some space for commercialism. “A Little More About You“, follows this exact strategy, with distinct attention to the vocal.
But that’s just about it: a fantastic vocal, with a chorus, a professional approach, and the cliché summer vibes that have become a norm for releases in June. The singer is Eddie Jonsson, and it was a brilliantly executed performance. The guitar sample in the background adds an exquisite nuance to the breakdown. I must mention, though I can’t do justice to the smooth transition from a Pop to a Future Bounce mood that was accomplished seamlessly.
The drop, however, seemed too generic. Dropgun did manage to fuse their electro house vibes in it, and with some attention, you can identify them… But “A Little More About You” lacks imagination in the section. It’s merely a standard formula, which emanates dynamic and catchy vibes, but nothing more. It could have been more inventive; I would have liked to hear that guitar again, for example.
Bottom line, “A Little More About You” was potentially a transcendent hit, but it does the job only partially. Summer is not the right period for finding creative ideas, but I was hyped by the breakdown and from the fact that Dropgun are rarely predictable. Anyway, it’s a proper release for the upcoming vacations; I can easily imagine it being played in radios and summertime clubs. Meanwhile, my quest to find more inventive tracks is still on.
