• Blend of Bass and Tech House
• Minimal but aggressive
With the renowned Dutch label of STMPD pushing out their own flavour of House music with the help of their multi-talented roster. Among this coveted list of musicians, the Dutch personage Loopers has made a steady and unhindered reputation in Martin Garrix’s label since the last couple of years. This Friday witnessed his latest release, “Groove Police”, a type of production which strikes a chord within a few seconds of its playback, emitting an energetic and groovy vibe meant for accelerating the after-hours dance-floor activity.
Loopers has reclaimed his place in STMPD with flair, not to forget his collaboration with native heavyweights Martin Garrix & Dyro. The preceding year, the esteemed solo act made explosive dance numbers such as “Out Of Control” (with Seth Hills), extrapolating and experimenting with the uprising Bass House segment. This definitely shows his effort in production, with his signature being unmistakably recognisable.
Talking about today’s instrumental, “Groove Police” resorts to a bass-heavy rhythm, which isn’t surprising. Driving cadence with filling percussion, the intro ascends into the first breakdown. Using a lead synth riff, whose intensity cleverly varies as the drop approaches, Loopers adeptly keeps the tension rising. Assorted with dirty Electro bass synths, the drop hits with a four by four pattern, reminding much of Tech House arrangements. Thanks to the distorted and swelling bassline cadence, the track maintain the much-needed aggression with flair.
As usual with any other creation from this artist, the applaud-worthy sound selection and unique style makes “Groove Police” imposingly dynamic and striking!
