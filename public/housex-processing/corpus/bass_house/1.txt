• Perfect amalgamation of signatures
• Playful but catchy breakdown
• Intricate drop hook with Dyro’s influence
What do we (or at least, I) expect from any collaboration?‌ We want to see how the styles merge together, if they have the chemistry to intrigue, and how they embedded their joint efforts in it. In the other example, I only hear 22Bullets:‌ no trace of Timmy and no trace of these random guys with a very hironic name. In “Warp‌ Speed”, there is a perfect combination between two colleagues that put their amazing efforts into a quality product.
Since their Revealed times, fans were dreaming about a team-up between the dirty electro house of Dyro (which has taken a more melodic approach lately, as we can hear) and the futuristic sounds of Julian Calor. “Warp‌ Speed”‌ is finally here, with a pack of interesting ideas attached!
Let’s start with the breakdown from Julian Calor: the Dutch talent built up an atmosphere with his usual unpredictable structure… It’s difficult to pen it down, honestly:‌ Julian slowly frolics with the notes, adding emotional vibes in the background that relaxes the listener, but reminding constantly that the climax is in due… elevating… It’s simply JC style: comparing it to something else is unnecessary.
Dyro brutally introduces a signature distorted vocal paired with his screeching lead: it doesn’t swap its spot with the previously described aura, but rather accompanies it into the drop. Evidently, Dyro’s influence is mostly there, despite probably Julian Calor having to do something with the complex melody. As said, Dyro’s growls, following a melodic pattern, are set free to explode, emanating as much energy as possible.
Personally, a couple of moments were slightly haphazard for me, probably because of the high pitches. Nonetheless, “Warp Speed” has enjoyable segments, all credits due to the adept forces behind it!
