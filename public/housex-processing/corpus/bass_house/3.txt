• First team-up between two giants of the current Bass House scene
• Very similar to “Hyper”…
• Excellent job on the breakdown’s loop
Expecting something more from the talented names involved here, and not something similar to “Hyper”, unfortunately, the EP contains similar naming and hence coincidences remain here. Released a couple of weeks back by STMPD RCRDS, today’s victim is the result obtained by the renowned House music aliases Siks and Julian Jordan: “Juice”.
Speaking more precisely, the potential in the premise here was pretty convincing. Siks is a talented up-and-coming mastermind in the Future House and Bass House scene, often capable to derive some twists to the formulas overused by many others, and is captured through a funky or more experimental sense. Similarly, Julian Joran has developed his glitchy Bass Hosue style and has evolved a lot, with hits such as “Diamonds” and “Funk” with his long-time colleague Garrix, yet shining through with solo efforts such as “Thunder” and “Hyper”, my favorite among the bunch.
In hopes for a juicier outcome (no pun intended) from their time shared on their collaboration efforts on this, I particularly felt that the squeaky lead and the melody deployed were rather predictable if one has heard any previous releases from Jordan. The breakdown introduces Siks’ specialty with vocal loops, inserting a sort of exciting climax and partially dissolved with a standard transition in the build-up section. I wasn’t fully satisfied, even though I dig the energy consistent in the bassline (it’s Bass House after all!) and how the duo enacted a hooking pattern. It’s just that “Juice” doesn’t bring any ‘out of the box’ twist that I was eagerly awaiting, and that’s a big opportunity missed.
