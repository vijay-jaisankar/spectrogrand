The recently released EP from Avicii titled “Avici” has not only got some amazing responses but some great remixes too. One of such fine remixes is from the Norwegian producer Jack Taylor. Giving an emotional progressive twist to the original song, the remix stands out and delivers some great vibes. The young artist followed the Nort European trend of making beautiful and emotional progressive, and once again I’m proud to announce a new talent to check out!
The remix starts out with a energetic intro, including the lovely guitar snippet from the original track. Smoothly guiding into the breakdown, the original track comes up. Just as the break from the original track changes to the drop, an charming guitar melody comes up…. It really feels like a piece of the previous version and blends in perfectly. An example of good transition!
The drop feels epic with the same melody, now backed with some more saw synths and the same guitar melody. I really have to admire Jack’s idea of extending the guitar element in the whole track and give it a nice feelgood-ness. Fun Fact – Jacob admits that the guitar melody just before and in the drop is actually from a real guitar as he knows to play it).
My conclusion would be that this remix indeed strikes out and proficiently adds a more emotive touch to the original version. I definitely recommend it.
