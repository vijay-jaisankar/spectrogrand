• Special care in the breakdown’s atmosphere
• Subtle editing in the vocal
• Another milestone for the duo Wildvibes-Patrick Key
A couple of years ago I wrote a piece about Wildvibes, a young guy that impressed me with his quality Progressive House. I kept watching him growing, reaching new and important milestones. I saw him earning his first support on Hardwell on Air in 2017, his first million plays on SC, then an official main release a few months ago… And now, with his loyal partner Patrick Key, there is another important release on Maxximize, “Meant For You“. Blasterjaxx’s label doesn’t have many releases, but it’s finding promising names, such as Declain, ANG and Mountblaq.
The duo Wildvibes-Patrick Key is accompanied by Lasso the Sun, providing an excellent performance with some high-pitched segments that add a refreshing twist to a classic element of the genre. A sweet guitar and a piano support Lasso the Sun in the breakdown, in a calm and delicate section. The vibe is almost “poppish”, until the Progressive House lead slowly introducing itselfs in the buildup, escalating into a powerful drop. Manse (who worked with Wildvibes in “Our Simphony”) made this “sweet” kind of Progressive famous, but Wildvibes and Patrick Key have added a further layer of passion into it. It gives me peaceful vibes. In addition to that familiar feeling, we have a splendid melodic pattern.
A final detail that I want to describe is the second breakdown, where the poppish vibe is replaced by an elegant sequence of strings. The precision and the care put into these “calmer” sections, which are often too predictable in Progressive House, are amazing. I almost had more fun exploring them than with the drops!
Wildvibes and Patrick Key made a true gem. “Meant For You” has everything: a quality vocal, a fantastic melody, a “passionate” atmosphere that (in my opinion) is incredibly underrated and a special care in adding a magical aura to the breakdowns. I’m so proud of these guys!
