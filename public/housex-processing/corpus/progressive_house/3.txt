• Quality vocal from Michel Zitron
• Predictable drop, we are all aware of the formula
• High technical quality and sound design, but also expectations…
Dutch sensation Martin Garrix has been widely known for his canorous Progressive sound, besides creating radio-compatible hits simultaneously. In particular, we are talking about his compositions together with Matisse & Sadko. These guys have created many dance-floor bops together, among which “Break Through The Silence“, “Dragon“, “Together“, “Forever” has made it absolutely worthwhile. Their next venture is yet another festival ground-breaker, which goes by the name “Hold On” featuring the Swedish singer Michel Zitron on the vocals.
Over the last few years, it has become a commonplace fact that their sound blend goes very well together, as demonstrated in their previous records. This one has been constructed similarly in a very flourishing way nonetheless. The song starts off with a very signature Martin fashion, and later the lyrics by Michel Zitron are followed by a healthy dosage of piano chords, not to forget the immense drop following afterwards.
“Hold On” is begging to differ because of the vox presence, all credits due to the reputed vocalist who is praised for his powerful and emulsifying vocals. The breakdown in the drop is adeptly used as a vocal chop, which contributes to the vibrant drop in the record. Personally, we consider Zitron’s performance our favourite of the 5 collaborations.
The question nonetheless arises: shall there be any evolution to this endeared yet repetitive sound in the coming time? Many fans have compared the drop to their previous work “Dragon” and, sincerely, this sound is becoming quite a clichè from these names. We are expecting more innovation, in future.
Nevertheless, yet another quality release has been added to Martin’s radiant discography!
