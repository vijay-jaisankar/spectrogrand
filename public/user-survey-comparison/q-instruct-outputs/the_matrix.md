The first image is more creative. While both images have a clear and distinct style, the first image has a more complex and intricate design, with a variety of shapes and patterns that create a sense of depth and texture. The use of color in the first image also adds to its visual interest, with the contrast between the green lines and the dark background. In contrast, the second image has a simpler design, with a single dominant color and a less complex structure. Therefore, the first image is judged to be more creative due to its richer visual content and more dynamic use of color and shape.
