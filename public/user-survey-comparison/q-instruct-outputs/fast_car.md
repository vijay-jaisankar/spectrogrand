The first image is more creative. While both images are stylized and have a retro aesthetic, the first image has more visual complexity and a greater range of colors. The composition is also more dynamic, with the car and cityscape arranged in a way that draws the viewer's eye across the image. The second image, while clear and well-defined, has a more limited color palette and a simpler composition. Therefore, the first image is judged to be more creative.
